this model depicts a geomodel of a ductile deformation 
we observe here a subsurface model of an anticline 
we see here a subsurface representation of an anticline 
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression 
we observe here a section with a folded deformation 
we observe here a subsurface representation of a folded deformation
